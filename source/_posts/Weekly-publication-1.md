## Summary
This week, I have been back to SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY. I'm very glad that senior sister give me a great hand and now I have been settle down. This is new start in my study life.
I have read some matrials about image segmentation, such as papers, blog and so on and learn that the popular ways in this field is R-CNN, faster R-CNN and FCN. But I foud it hard to recurrent the result in my computer, because their program was coded in Caffe and ran in such powerful computer with excellent GPU. I need to take more time to learn about it.
What's more, I have read the paper about Tensorflow, _TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems_, which I will reivew in the next chapter. 
To be honest, I just code little this week, which I should pay attention to.

## Paper reading
The paper [_**TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems**_](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45166.pdf) was wrote by the creator of tensorflow. In this paper, I has learn the born of tensorflow, and many basic concepts and theories such graph, session and so on, and some basic operation such as matmul, assign and so on. OK, I have learn it before.
### Adavantages
- Tensorflow is widely used inside Google.
- It give us many excellent API and reduce our repeated work.
- It can run in both Single-Devic and Multi-Device and can do good job in Multi-Device.
- It optimize many expensive operation.
- It's focus on deep learning, but can be used in many other fields.

### Disavantages
- Mamery managment is too complex and hope to be better.

## Problems I meet
- Many concepts I even never heard before, so I can't not get the full point in fact. In the other word, I have no idea about this problems.
- It's hard for me to read the paper in English. I need to improve my English ability step by step from now on. In fact, I am just writing this weekly report with Google Translate : )
- In fact, many programs in paper did not achieve in Tensorflow. It's good for us to get famliar with one tool first, such as Tensorflow, but we should not limit our eyes.
- How to get more Good resources which express Tensorflow souce code, especially in Chinese : )

## Next week's flags
- get familiar with FCN, next week's paper is [_**Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation**_](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)
- Sort out what I learn in Udacity and publish the blog;
